# LeoConsole-apkg-builder

This program builds package archives for
[LeoConsole](https://github.com/BoettcherDasOriginal/LeoConsole) from source
code repositories.

*Currently it is written in Python, but in future, a Go rewrite will be created,
so it can be compiled and integrated into LeoConsole*
