# LeoConsole-apkg-builder

This program builds package archives for
[LeoConsole](https://github.com/BoettcherDasOriginal/LeoConsole) from source
code repositories.

*You can use it as a standalone program, but it is already integrated in the
apkg plugin.*

## Usage

```sh
apkg-builder [IData] <folder>
```

(`IData` is passed by LeoConsole, you don't need it, if you call apkg-builder
from your shell)
